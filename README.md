# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this week's challenge, I created an application that will allow users to search weather conditions by city.

To allow the app to be as user friendly as possible, users may click on their search results to visit previous results. This project was valuable to my knowledge and expertise and I hope it may be valuable to all users seeking reliable weather information. 

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Accaptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
